These are some of the projects on analytics-regression models, text mining, ML algos etc that I am working on. The starters are pretty east and anyone who is starting out will find them helpful in description. It may also happen that some of my initial models are not as accurate as they should have been-but with future revisions, I am improving upon them as well.
